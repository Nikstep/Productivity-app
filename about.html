        <h2>What is Pomodoro technique?</h2>
        <p>
          The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by
          Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to
          break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length,
          separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro,
          from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen
          timer that Cirillo used as a university student. <br />
          The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and
          websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to
          concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental
          development used in software design, the method has been adopted in
          pair programming contexts.
